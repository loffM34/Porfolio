      Hey! I’m a third-year Computer Science student at Stevens Institute of 
      Technology with a passion for building meaningful, creative tech especially in 
      software engineering and AI. I love working on projects that challenge me, 
      solve real-world problems, and bring people together.
    </p>
  
    <p className="mt-4 text-xl text-gray-600">
      Outside of coding, I’m super into soccer, surfing, 
      and tennis.I also enjoy teaching and mentoring: I’ve coached a rec soccer team, 
      taught STEM at iCode, and served as President of the Brookdale CS Club. 
      Now, I’m part of Stevens Blueprint, where I help build tech for nonprofits.
    </p>
  
    <p className="mt-4 mb-8 text-xl text-gray-600">
      Lately, I’ve been focused on a few exciting projects, 
        like a surf forecast web app, an alumni directory for my fraternity, 
        and some AI classification tools. I’m always down to collaborate, 
        try something new, and build things that make a difference.
